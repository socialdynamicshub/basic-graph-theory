Sometimes, we are not interested in a particular graph, but rather a class of graphs.\nIf you had to come up with a random way of creating a graph, how would you do it?\nErdös and Renyi asked themselves the same thing. They came up with a model that is now known as the ER model.\nStart with a fixed number of nodes. Now take each pair of nodes and add an edge between them with probability \\(p\\).\nThere are several things to note about this model.\nFirst of all, what could you say about the density of that graph? If you create a sufficient number of random graphs this way, the average network density will be very close to \\(p\\).\nThere is another way of setting up the model. Start with a fixed number of nodes. Now take a fixed number of edges smaller or equal the number of possible edges. Put a random edge into the network until you have as many edges as you chose.\nThis way of setting up the network has the advantage that you can control the network density precisely. Every graph set up this way will have the same network density.\n\n\n\n",

Although they can be huge in terms of node count, the average path length between two nodes remains small. Really small in some cases.\nIf you take a social network, for instance, there are some famous experiments that show that any two nodes in the network are usually not separated by more than six degrees (the infamous six degrees of separation).\nIn pop science speak, this means that you are a mere six social connections away from the Queen of England.\nThe Erdös-Renyi model does not capture this property.\nAs it had been the predominant random graph model that was used for all kinds of purposes for some time, the field was ready for a new model.\nThe decisive innovation came from Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, hence the name Watts-Strogatz model (WS model).\nStart with a regular ring lattice.\n\n\n\nThis is a regular ring lattice. There are two parameters that you already have to give the WS model to construct this lattice: \\(N\\) is the number of nodes and \\(k\\) is the mean node degree.\nIn the case of a regular ring lattice, the mean node degree is assumed to be an even number. In colloquial terms, you construct it by arranging the nodes in a circle and attaching each node to its \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\) neighbors on each side. That last one is a mouth full. Let’s look at it in detail.\nConsider the graph above again and look at node 1. It attaches to \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) on one side and to \\(10\\) and \\(9\\) on the other. Node \\(2\\) attaches to \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) on the one side and to \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) on the other. You can check this for every node and see that they all attach to \\(2\\) other nodes on each side. Hence the parameter \\(k\\), in this case, is \\(4\\).\nHere is an example with \\(k = 6\\):\n\n\n\nAnd for good measure, here is a lattice with \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\n\nLet’s return to the first graph:\n\n\n\nSuppose the above graph is the regular ring lattice you constructed. The WS model algorithm now proceeds as follows:\nFirst, there is yet another parameter that we need, \\(\\beta\\). Start with node 1 now and go through each edge that attaches to it. Reroute each edge to another node with probability \\(\\beta\\). The node to reroute to is drawn uniformly at random while avoiding self-loops. This means that you put all the other nodes (excluding the node in question, in this case node 1) in a bag and just draw a new node to attach the edge to.\nHere are some samples that were generated by this model:\n\\(\\beta = 0.3\\):\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta = 0.1\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta = 0.9\\)\n\n\n\nTask\nCan you guess what happens if you set \\(\\beta = 1\\)?\nTask\nImplement this model in Julia.

As you can see, each node is labelled with a number which is how we usually keep track of nodes. Labeling nodes with numbers is not obligatory though. You can call your nodes whatever you want as long they are uniquely identifiable (which is why we call the node labels IDs). Sticking with the number labeling, though, we can define the set of nodes more formally by:\n\\[\nN = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\n\\]\nEdges are simply described as pairs of nodes: \\(\\{a, b\\}, \\text{where a, b } \\in N\\). Notice that we use the set notation for an edge here because the order of the nodes in an edge does not play a role (Yet! More on that later…). In this specific case, the set of edges is given by:\n\\[\nE = \\{\\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 5\\}, \\{1, 7\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{2, 6\\}, \\{3, 5\\}, \\{3, 6\\}, \\{4, 5\\}, \\{6, 7\\}\\}\n\\]\nIn summary, the graph is fully described by:\n\\[\nG = (N, E), \\text{where N is the set of nodes and E is the set of edges.}\n\\]\nNow that we have seen our first graph, let’s take a look at some other ones.

They are “things” and how these “things” are connected to one another.\nThere are a lot of upsides to modeling relationships with graphs. First of all, graphs are very well formalized discrete mathematical structures. No matter the domain that we are modeling, we can profit from a large toolbox of mathematical analysis techniques and metrics.\nNow, what could we model with graphs?\nThe possibilities are really endless. You could model a social network where vertices are people and edges are relationships between them. This opens the gates for a flood of questions that you could ask about such a network. Can we find people that are very well connected? Can we identify cohesive communities in the network? Are there people who link two communities together? All these questions and many more can be addressed in a graph theoretic approach.\nYou could also model an electric grid with a graph. In this case, vertices would be transformation stations and edges would be powerlines. You could ask whether the malfunctioning of one station could lead to outages in another region. Or identify stations that could be considered high-risk targets of sabotage attacks.\nAnother example is traffic. A network could be the model for streets and crossings. Artificial cars could “drive” through the network. Now you can investigate what happens if an accident blocks an important crossing. Is there an enhanced risk of congestions? Are certain areas at a higher risk to experience congestions? How could building a new road aleviate traffic in an area that has a school?\nThese are only three examples and they all employ only the simplest of possible graph models. There are a lot more specifications of graphs that can be used for more specific problems (for instance, what happens if the relationships, i.e., the edges, are directed, or what if we differentiate between the importance of edges and attach a weight to them?).\n\n\n\n",
