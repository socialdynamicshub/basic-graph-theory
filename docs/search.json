What if the relationship represented by an edge is directed?\nThat’s what directed graphs are for!\nWe draw a directed graph simply by putting an arrow head on one side of an edge:\n\n\n\nWhy would we need directed graphs?\nConsider the social media site Twitter.\nHow do you connect to people on Twitter? You follow them. Following someone on Twitter is a one-sided connection. If you follow a celebrity, you get their updates on your feed, but they do not get yours in their feed. If we were to model Twitter as a network graph, we would model this relationship with directed edges.\nIn contrast, a Facebook friendship is different. You send someone a friend request and then you are connected both ways. This relationship could be modeled with undirected edges.\nIn undirected graphs, edges can be modeled as sets of two nodes because the order of nodes doesn’t matter. Directed graphs, however, cannot be formalized this way because the order of nodes in an edge matters. This is why we use Tuples to model edges. The notation for the graph above is the following:\n\\[\nG = (N, E) \\\\\nN = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\} \\\\\nE = \\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 7), (6, 2), (6, 7), (7, 1)\\}\n\\]\n\n\n\n",

They came up with a model that is now known as the ER model.\nStart with a fixed number of nodes. Now take each pair of nodes and add an edge between them with probability \\(p\\).\nThere are several things to note about this model.\nFirst of all, what could you say about the density of that graph? If you create a sufficient number of random graphs this way, the average network density will be very close to \\(p\\).\nThere is another way of setting up the model. Start with a fixed number of nodes. Now take a fixed number of edges smaller or equal the number of possible edges. Put a random edge into the network until you have as many edges as you chose.\nThis way of setting up the network has the advantage that you can control the network density precisely. Every graph set up this way will have the same network density.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nTo learn the basics of graph theory, you need nothing more than pen and paper. However, once you move on to more complex analyses, you will need a computer. Graphs are so fundamental to such a diverse range of tasks, that virtually every programming language has a library that provides tools to create and analyze graphs.\nHere, we will have a quick look into Graphs.jl, a Julia library for graphs.\nIf you have never worked with Julia before, we would recommend that you learn the basics of Julia first. [TODO: write basic julia tutorial]\n\n\n\nTo install the library, simply call:\n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Graphs\")\nPkg.add(\"GraphPlots\")\nPkg.add(\"Compose\")\nPkg.add(\"GraphRecipes\")\nPkg.add(\"Plots\")\n\nTo load the library in your script, exexcute the following:\n\nusing Graphs\n\nThe using keyword brings the everything that the Graphs library exports into your global scope.\nNow that you have Graphs.jl installed and loaded, we can start working with it. Let’s begin by creating a simple graph and plotting:\n\ng = SimpleGraph(5)\n\nadd_edge!(g, 1, 2)\nadd_edge!(g, 3, 4)\nadd_edge!(g, 2, 4)\nadd_edge!(g, 1, 5)\nadd_edge!(g, 2, 5)\nadd_edge!(g, 4, 5)\n\nThis first simple snippet of julia code already tells us a lot. First, incidentally, this is how we usually set up a julia workflow in a script. You load the libraries at the top of the script and then move on to perform the task that the script is supposed to perform. In this case, we first constructed an empty undirected graph with 5 nodes (g = SimpleGraph(5)). Empty in this case means that the graph has no edges.\nThen we proceeded to add six edges to the graph (e.g., add_edge!(g, 1, 2) for “add an edge to g from node 1 to node 2”). The ! is a julia convention for functions that manipulate an object in-place. It is important to keep this in mind. Here, it means that by simply calling the function, we modify the object g without having to assign it again.\nLet’s see whether everything went as planned:\n\nusing Plots, GraphRecipes\ngraphplot(g, curves = false, names = collect(1:nv(g)), markersize = 0.2)\n\n\nTask\nCheck if you can verify whether the graph in the plot is the correct visualization for the graph that we created before.\n\n\n\n",

Although they can be huge in terms of node count, the average path length between two nodes remains small.

There are two parameters that you already have to give the WS model to construct this lattice: \\(N\\) is the number of nodes and \\(k\\) is the mean node degree.\nIn the case of a regular ring lattice, the mean node degree is assumed to be an even number. In colloquial terms, you construct it by arranging the nodes in a circle and attaching each node to its \\(\\frac{k}{2}\\) neighbors on each side. That last one is a mouth full. Let’s look at it in detail.\nConsider the graph above again and look at node 1. It attaches to \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) on one side and to \\(10\\) and \\(9\\) on the other. Node \\(2\\) attaches to \\(3\\) and \\(4\\) on the one side and to \\(1\\) and \\(10\\) on the other. You can check this for every node and see that they all attach to \\(2\\) other nodes on each side. Hence the parameter \\(k\\), in this case, is \\(4\\).\nHere is an example with \\(k = 6\\):\n\n\n\nAnd for good measure, here is a lattice with \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\n\nLet’s return to the first graph:\n\n\n\nSuppose the above graph is the regular ring lattice you constructed. The WS model algorithm now proceeds as follows:\nFirst, there is yet another parameter that we need, \\(\\beta\\). Start with node 1 now and go through each edge that attaches to it. Reroute each edge to another node with probability \\(\\beta\\). The node to reroute to is drawn uniformly at random while avoiding self-loops. This means that you put all the other nodes (excluding the node in question, in this case node 1) in a bag and just draw a new node to attach the edge to.\nHere are some samples that were generated by this model:\n\\(\\beta = 0.3\\):\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta = 0.1\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta = 0.9\\)\n\n\n\nTask\nCan you guess what happens if you set \\(\\beta = 1\\)?\nTask\nImplement this model in Julia.

Things in nature just seem to like to connect.\nLet’s consider a couple of examples.\nA social network\n[GRAPHIC OF SOCIAL NETWORK]\nCan we find people that are very well connected? Can we identify cohesive communities in the network? Are there people who link two communities together? All these questions and many more can be addressed in a graph theoretic approach.\nThe electrical grid\n[GRAPHIC OF ELECTRICAL GRID]\nHow would the malfunctioning of one station affect the overall distribution of electricity? Could an outage at one station lead to outages in another region? Which stations could be considered high-risk targets of sabotage attacks?\nTraffic\n[GRAPHIC OF TRAFFIC NETWORK]\nWhat happens if an accident blocks an important crossing? Is there an enhanced risk of congestions? Are certain areas at a higher risk to experience congestions? How could building a new road aleviate traffic in an area that has a school?\nThe brain\n[GRAPHIC OF NETWORK OF NEURONS]\nThere are literally countless more examples of what you could describe as a network.\nTask\nThink of three more things that have a networked structure.\nSo how would we model and analyze the examples above? That’s a question that we could decide ad hoc whenever we encounter the problem at hand. Luckily, we don’t have to. We can abstract away the essential structure of each of those and use a massive body of tools, metrics, and techniques that have been developed over centuries. That’s where graphs come into play.\n[GRAPHIC OF ABSTRACTION PROCESS]\nGraphs are very versatile models of almost any kind relationship. They are “things” and how these “things” are connected to one another.\nThere are a lot of upsides to modeling relationships with graphs. First of all, graphs are very well formalized discrete mathematical structures. No matter the domain that we are modeling, we can profit from a large toolbox of mathematical analysis techniques and metrics.\nThere are a lot more specifications of graphs that can be used for more specific problems (for instance, what happens if the relationships, i.e., the edges, are directed, or what if we differentiate between the importance of edges and attach a weight to them?).\n\n\n\n",
