Graphs are very versatile models of almost any kind relationship.
They are "things" and how these "things" are connected to one another.

There are a lot of upsides to modeling relationships with graphs.
First of all, graphs are very well formalized discrete mathematical structures.
No matter the domain that we are modeling, we can profit from a large toolbox of mathematical analysis techniques and metrics.

Now, what could we model with graphs?

The possibilities are really endless.
You could model a social network where vertices are people and edges are relationships between them.
This opens the gates for a flood of questions that you could ask about such a network.
Can we find people that are very well connected?
Can we identify cohesive communities in the network?
Are there people who link two communities together?
All these questions and many more can be addressed in a graph theoretic approach.

You could also model an electric grid with a graph.
In this case, vertices would be transformation stations and edges would be powerlines.
You could ask whether the malfunctioning of one station could lead to outages in another region.
Or identify stations that could be considered high-risk targets of sabotage attacks.

Another example is traffic.
A network could be the model for streets and crossings.
Artificial cars could "drive" through the network.
Now you can investigate what happens if an accident blocks an important crossing.
Is there an enhanced risk of congestions?
Are certain areas at a higher risk to experience congestions?
How could building a new road aleviate traffic in an area that has a school?

These are only three examples and they all employ only the simplest of possible graph models.
There are a lot more specifications of graphs that can be used for more specific problems (for instance, what happens if the relationships, i.e., the edges, are **directed**, or what if we differentiate between the importance of edges and attach a *weight* to them?).
